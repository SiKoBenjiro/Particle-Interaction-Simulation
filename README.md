Particle Simulator is an interactive educational application designed to simulate the motion of particles under the influence of electric and gravitational forces.

Users can:
    set particle parameters (charge, mass, velocity, angle, etc.);
    choose numerical integration methods (Verlet, Leapfrog, Runge-Kutta, etc.);
    control visualization settings;
    run simulations in real time or over a precisely defined time interval.
This program was developed as part of the thesis project “Theory of Chemical Bonding: The Principle of Correspondence” to demonstrate the fundamentals of classical mechanics to students of the Faculty of Physics at Belarusian State University by Egor Novik.
